## Challenge 6 - Data Sourcing Challenge

## Description

This is one of the challenges from the UNC/EDx AI Bootcamp course. Challenge 6 provided a starter jupyter file and required the coder to interact with an api. 


## Usage
The output dataset provides movie data information for movies reviewed in NYT and available in TMDB. Please note that some movies were missed despite being available in TMDB. The challenge instructions required us to use a code that relied on a NYT column (e.g. "headline.main") being formatted a specific way (titles within parentheses followed by the word 'Review') which wasn't consistent within the column

## Project Status

Completed.

I used chatgpt to explain a few error messages I received as detailed within the jupyter notebook comments.
